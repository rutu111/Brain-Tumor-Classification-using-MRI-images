# Brain-Tumor-Classification-using-MRI-images

Machine Learning Project CS 6140 Spring 2022 (Rutuja, Akshat, and Srijha)

The objective of this project is to explore various supervised machine learning techniques to classify brain tumors from MRI images of brain scans. Multinomial Logistic Regression, Support vector machine and various Neural Network models (Convolutional Neural Network, and Mo- bileNet). will be leveraged to classify the types of tumors from MRI images. The trained models will then be tested on unseen MRI images to evaluate which model(s) are more suited for the classification of brain tumors which will be followed by a comparative analysis of the models.
